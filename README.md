My main objective was to create a smart mirror that gives users the answers they need immediately from their household with all information they could need.

Commmon uses include:

- Track Health status and goals
- Check the weather for the week
- Get latest news all accessible with the click of the forcast app
- Take a look at emails and stay up to date on their inbox

All of these features come with their own individual applications. So no need to worry about the mirror's space being taken up by too much information.
